- multispectra_holo4_003_HD200654_20250921_AuxTel_v3.2.1_doSensorFlat_FreePressure_throughput.txt was created using v3.2.1 c5cecc19375c083ada48a2b7ed04d76d2eec8b65 commit, with 20250921 HD200654 data extracted with ratio 2/1, fixed A1s and A2s, binning=1, free angstrom exponent, free ozone, masking of curve edges and absorption lines; atmospheric parameters converged to 
VAOD: 0.037 +0.002 -0.002 bounds=(0, 1)
angstrom_exp: 1.8 +0.2 -0.2 bounds=(0, 3)
ozone [db]: 348 +28 -28 bounds=(np.float64(0.0), np.float64(625.0))
PWV [mm]: 1.0 +0.1 -0.1 bounds=(np.float64(0.0), np.float64(20.25))
The night was chosen having CHI2_FIT < 2 and low PWV ~ 1mm.
multispectra_holo4_003_HD200654_20250921_OG550_65mm_1_AuxTel_v3.2.1_doSensorFlat_FreePressure_throughput.txt and multispectra_holo4_003_multi_20251214_BG40_65mm_1_AuxTel_v3.2.1_doSensorFlat_FreePressure_throughput.txt were created similarly using data taken on 20251214 with HD200654 and multispectra respectively, using the above empty transmission file. 
BG40_65mm_1 and OG550_65mm_1 are copies of these two files.
