- transmission.txt : prediction from the chimera built with LPNHE optical test bench measurements between 430 and 1000nm, then extrapolating with an hologram efficiency model fitted on data
- ratio_order_2over1.txt : computed using separated extraction of spectrum order 1 and 2 from BG40 exposures, nights 20220608, 20220628, 20220629 and 20220630 with ratio 3/2 model, CCD_REBIN=2 with Savitsky Golay filter, extrapolated fitting an hologram transmission model (see ratio_order_2over1_from_fit.txt)
- ratio_order_3over2.txt : prediction from the chimera built with LPNHE optical test bench measurements between 430 and 1000nm, rescaled with the estimate using SDSSg filter ratio of orders, extrapolated fitting an hologram transmission model (see ratio_order_2over1_from_fit.txt)
